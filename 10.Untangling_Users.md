# Untangling Users

## Becoming the root with su
It's not just hackers that need to become root. Oftentimes, you, as the owner of your computer, need to use root access to administer it. Becoming root is a fairly common action that Linux users take, and there are two utilities that exist for this purpose: su and sudo.

In this challenge, we will cover the older one, su (the substitute user command). This is not typically used to elevate to root access anymore, but it is an elegant utility from a more civilized time, and we'll cover it first.

su is a setuid binary:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ ls -l /usr/bin/su
-rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 232416 Dec 1 11:45 /usr/bin/su
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Because it has the SUID bit set, su runs as root. Running as root, it can start a root shell! Of course, su is discerning: before allowing the user to elevate privileges to root, it checks to make sure that the user knows the root password:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ su
Password: 
su: Authentication failure
hacker@dojo:~$
```
This check against the root password is what obsoletes su. Modern systems very rarely have root passwords, and different mechanisms (that we will learn later) are used to grant administrative access.

But THIS challenge (and only this challenge) does have a root password. That password is hack-the-planet, and you must provide it to su to become root! Go do that, and read the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8tL5Lz11XRRj-Ng2GAA6NR45sX7.QX1UDN1wCO4kjNzEzW}`

i first got into becoming the root user then checked the files using ls and used cat on potential files that could be the flag

```
hacker@users~becoming-root-with-su:~$ su
Password:
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# ls
1  COLLEGE  Desktop  PWN  a  instructions  myflag  not-the-flag  output.txt  pwn  tee  the-flag
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# cat myflag

[FLAG] Here is your flag:
[FLAG] pwn.college{kyWvn-mun6E3TpUPnVPA25YREM6.QX3YTN0wCO4kjNzEzW}

root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# cat the-flag
 |
\|/ This is the first half:
 v
pwn.college{ceeZIKBQQ1Yy0N3vnneWv-HOhjx.QX3ATO0wCO4kjNzEzW}
                              ^
     that is the second half /|\
                              |

If you only see the second half above, you redirected in *truncate* mode (>)
rather than *append* mode (>>), and so the write of the second half to stdout
overwrote the initial write of the first half directly to the file. Try append
mode!
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker# cat not-the-flag
pwn.college{8tL5Lz11XRRj-Ng2GAA6NR45sX7.QX1UDN1wCO4kjNzEzW}
root@users~becoming-root-with-su:/home/hacker#
```
