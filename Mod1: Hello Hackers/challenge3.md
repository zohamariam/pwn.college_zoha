# Hello Hackers

## Command History
You're going to type a lot of commands, and typing everything from scratch can be annoying. Luckily, the shell saves a history of every command you invoke.

You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history. Bring up a terminal, hit the up arrow, and grab it! In other challenges, the history will contain the log of the commands you've run, so if you need to run a similar command again, you can use the arrow keys to scroll through and find it!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wbclMv1md_8ML27vsj2v9z_tZ4B.0lNzEzNxwCO4kjNzEzW}`

```
hacker@hello~command-history:~$ the flag is pwn.college{wbclMv1md_8ML27vsj2v9z_tZ4B.0lNzEzNxwCO4kjNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
History of every command invoked can be obtained by scrolling with the help of up/down arrow keys. This will be helpful in other challenges that require a lot of commands to be written.
