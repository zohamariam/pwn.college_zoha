# Practising Piping

## Redirecting output
First, let's look at redirecting stdout to files. You can accomplish this with the > character, as so:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi > asdf
```
This will redirect the output of echo hi (which will be hi) to the file asdf. You can then use a program such as cat to output this file:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ cat asdf
hi
```
In this challenge, you must use this output redirection to write the word PWN (all uppercase) to the filename COLLEGE (all uppercase).

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Qkl-F7fHHLlWheSQh5WjBze5Xp3.QX0YTN0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

```
hacker@piping~redirecting-output:~$ echo PWN > COLLEGE
Correct! You successfully redirected 'PWN' to the file 'COLLEGE'! Here is your
flag:
pwn.college{Qkl-F7fHHLlWheSQh5WjBze5Xp3.QX0YTN0wCO4kjNzEzW}
```

## Redirecting more output
Aside from redirecting the output of echo, you can, of course, redirect the output of any command.
In this level, /challenge/run will once more give you a flag, but only if you redirect its output to the file myflag. Your flag will, of course, end up in the myflag file!

You'll notice that /challenge/run will still happily print to your terminal, despite you redirecting stdout. 
That's because it communicates its instructions and feedback over standard error, and only prints the flag over standard out!

**Flag:** `pwn.college{sZmgAjlSkbVoDhQdgq1Fk5Xg2Nn.QX1YTN0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

```

## Appending output
A common use-case of output redirection is to save off some command results for later analysis. Often times, you want to do this in aggregate: run a bunch of commands, save their output, and grep through it later. In this case, you might want all that output to keep appending to the same file, but > will create a new output file every time, deleting the old contents.

You can redirect input in append mode using >> instead of >, as so:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo pwn > outfile
hacker@dojo:~$ echo college >> outfile
hacker@dojo:~$ cat outfile
pwn
college
hacker@dojo:$
```
To practice, run /challenge/run with an append-mode redirect of the output to the file /home/hacker/the-flag. The practice will write the first half of the flag to the file, and the second half to stdout if stdout is redirected to the file. If you properly redirect in append-mode, the second half will be appended to the first, but if you redirect in truncation mode (>), the second half will overwrite the first and you won't get the flag!

Go for it now!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{ceeZIKBQQ1Yy0N3vnneWv-HOhjx.QX3ATO0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ /challenge/run >> /home/hacker/the-flag
[INFO] WELCOME! This challenge makes the following asks of you:
[INFO] - the challenge will check that output is redirected to a specific file path : /home/hacker/the-flag

[HYPE] ONWARDS TO GREATNESS!

[INFO] This challenge will perform a bunch of checks.
[INFO] Good luck!

[TEST] You should have redirected my stdout to a file called /home/hacker/the-flag. Checking...

[HINT] File descriptors are inherited from the parent, unless the FD_CLOEXEC is set by the parent on the file descriptor.
[HINT] For security reasons, some programs, such as python, do this by default in certain cases. Be careful if you are
[HINT] creating and trying to pass in FDs in python.

[PASS] The file at the other end of my stdout looks okay!
[PASS] Success! You have satisfied all execution requirements.
I will write the flag in two parts to the file /home/hacker/the-flag! I'll do
the first write directly to the file, and the second write, I'll do to stdout
(if it's pointing at the file). If you redirect the output in append mode, the
second write will append to (rather than overwrite) the first write, and you'll
get the whole flag!
hacker@piping~appending-output:~$ cat the-flag
 |
\|/ This is the first half:
 v
pwn.college{ceeZIKBQQ1Yy0N3vnneWv-HOhjx.QX3ATO0wCO4kjNzEzW}
                              ^
     that is the second half /|\
                              |

If you only see the second half above, you redirected in *truncate* mode (>)
rather than *append* mode (>>), and so the write of the second half to stdout
overwrote the initial write of the first half directly to the file. Try append
mode!
```

### New Learnings

## Redirecting errors
Just like standard output, you can also redirect the error channel of commands. Here, we'll learn about File Descriptor numbers. A File Descriptor (FD) is a number that describes a communication channel in Linux. You've already been using them, even though you didn't realize it. We're already familiar with three:

* FD 0: Standard Input
* FD 1: Standard Output
* FD 2: Standard Error

When you redirect process communication, you do it by FD number, though some FD numbers are implicit. For example, a > without a number implies 1>, which redirects FD 1 (Standard Output). Thus, the following two commands are equivalent:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi > asdf
hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi 1> asdf
```
Redirecting errors is pretty easy from this point. If you have a command that might produce data via standard error (such as /challenge/run), you can do:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ /challenge/run 2> errors.log
```
That will redirect standard error (FD 2) to the errors.log file. Furthermore, you can redirect multiple file descriptors at the same time! For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ some_command > output.log 2> errors.log
```
That command will redirect output to output.log and errors to errors.log.

Let's put this into practice! In this challenge, you will need to redirect the output of /challenge/run, like before, to myflag, and the "errors" (in our case, the instructions) to instructions. You'll notice that nothing will be printed to the terminal, because you have redirected everything! You can find the instructions/feedback in instructions and the flag in myflag when you successfully pull this off!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kyWvn-mun6E3TpUPnVPA25YREM6.QX3YTN0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

## Redirecting input
Just like you can redirect output from programs, you can redirect input to programs! This is done using <, as so:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo yo > message
hacker@dojo:~$ cat message
yo
hacker@dojo:~$ rev < message
oy
```
You can do interesting things with a lot of different programs using input redirection! In this level, we will practice using /challenge/run, which will require you to redirect the PWN file to it and have the PWN file contain the value COLLEGE! To write that value to the PWN file, recall the prior challenge on output redirection from echo!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{AJhuQ3ePZj8aQLSBVM19fhQWKzd.QXwcTN0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

Reading from standard input...
Correct! You have redirected the PWN file into my standard input, and I read
the value 'COLLEGE' out of it!

## Grepping stored results
You know how to run commands, how to redirect their output (e.g., >), and how to search through the resulting file (e.g., grep). Let's put this together!

In preparation for more complex levels, we want you to:

1. Redirect the output of /challenge/run to /tmp/data.txt.
2. This will result in a hundred thousand lines of text, with one of them being the flag, in /tmp/data.txt.
3. grep that for the flag!

### Solve

## Grepping live output
It turns out that you can "cut out the middleman" and avoid the need to store results to a file, like you did in the last level. You can do this by using the | (pipe) operator. Standard output from the command to the left of the pipe will be connected to (piped into) the standard input of the command to the right of the pipe. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo no-no | grep yes
hacker@dojo:~$ echo yes-yes | grep yes
yes-yes
hacker@dojo:~$ echo yes-yes | grep no
hacker@dojo:~$ echo no-no | grep no
no-no
```
Now try it for yourself! /challenge/run will output a hundred thousand lines of text, including the flag. grep for the flag!

## Grepping errors
You know how to redirect errors to a file, and you know how to pipe output to another program, such as grep. But what if you wanted to grep through errors directly?

The > operator redirects a given file descriptor to a file, and you've used 2> to redirect fd 2, which is standard error. The | operator redirects only standard output to another program, and there is no 2| form of the operator! It can only redirect standard output (file descriptor 1).

Luckily, where there's a shell, there's a way!

The shell has a >& operator, which redirects a file descriptor to another file descriptor. This means that we can have a two-step process to grep through errors: first, we redirect standard error to standard output (2>& 1) and then pipe the now-combined stderr and stdout as normal (|)!

Try it now! Like the last level, this level will overwhelm you with output, but this time on standard error. grep through it to find the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{8c4fHKq9tXOkYWHY1RujhBJTH_V.QX1ATO0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

## Filtering with grep -v
The grep command has a very useful option: -v (invert match). While normal grep shows lines that MATCH a pattern, grep -v shows lines that do NOT match a pattern:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ cat data.txt
hello hackers!
hello world!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat data.txt | grep -v world
hello hackers!
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Sometimes, the only way to filter to just the data you want is to filter out the data you don't want. In this challenge, /challenge/run will output the flag to stdout, but it will also output over 1000 decoy flags (containing the word DECOY somewhere in the flag) mixed in with the real flag. You'll need to filter out the decoys while keeping the real flag!

Use grep -v to filter out all the lines containing "DECOY" and reveal the real flag!

## Duplicating piped data with tee
When you pipe data from one command to another, you of course no longer see it on your screen. This is not always desired: for example, you might want to see the data as it flows through between your commands to debug unintended outcomes (e.g., "why did that second command not work???").

Luckily, there is a solution! The tee command, named after a "T-splitter" from plumbing pipes, duplicates data flowing through your pipes to any number of files provided on the command line. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo hi | tee pwn college
hi
hacker@dojo:~$ cat pwn
hi
hacker@dojo:~$ cat college
hi
hacker@dojo:~$
```
As you can see, by providing two files to tee, we ended up with three copies of the piped-in data: one to stdout, one to the pwn file, and one to the college file. You can imagine how you might use this to debug things going haywire:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ command_1 | command_2
Command 2 failed!
hacker@dojo:~$ command_1 | tee cmd1_output | command_2
Command 2 failed!
hacker@dojo:~$ cat cmd1_output
Command 1 failed: must pass --succeed!
hacker@dojo:~$ command_1 --succeed | command_2
Commands succeeded!
```
Now, you try it! This process' /challenge/pwn must be piped into /challenge/college, but you'll need to intercept the data to see what pwn needs from you!

This challenge took a lot of time for me to understand the usage of tee command. at first i used the tee in between input and output command and got a message given below, and then used tee /challenge/pwn which basically overwrote tee's output in pwn which made the /challenge/pwn ineffective to work and did some other combinations in the syntax to get idea of the usage of the command, then i realised theres no way i could retrieve the secret code from pwn without creating an external file to store pwn's output and did that to receive the secret code and used it to receive the flag.

## Process substitution for input
Sometimes you need to compare the output of two commands rather than two files. You might think to save each output to a file first:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ command1 > file1
hacker@dojo:~$ command2 > file2
hacker@dojo:~$ diff file1 file2
```
But there's a more elegant way! Linux follows the philosophy that "everything is a file". That is, the system strives to provide file-like access to most resources, including the input and output of running programs! The shell follows this philosophy, allowing you to, for example, use any utility that takes file arguments on the command line and hook it up to the output of programs, as you learned in the previous few levels.

Interestingly, we can go further, and hook input and output of programs to arguments of commands. This is done using Process Substitution. For reading from a command (input process substitution), use <(command). When you write <(command), bash will run the command and hook up its output to a temporary file that it will create. This isn't a real file, of course, it's what's called a named pipe, in that it has a file name:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo <(echo hi)
/dev/fd/63
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Where did /dev/fd/63 come from? bash replaced <(echo hi) with the path of the named pipe file that's hooked up to the command's output! While the command is running, reading from this file will read data from the standard output of the command. Typically, this is done using commands that take input files as arguments:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ cat <(echo hi)
hi
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Of course, you can specify this multiple times:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo <(echo pwn) <(echo college)
/dev/fd/63 /dev/fd/64
hacker@dojo:~$ cat <(echo pwn) <(echo college)
pwn
college
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Now for your challenge! Recall what you learned in the diff challenge from Comprehending Commands. In that challenge, you diffed two files. Now, you'll diff two sets of command outputs: /challenge/print_decoys, which will print a bunch of decoy flags, and /challenge/print_decoys_and_flag which will print those same decoys plus the real flag.

Use process substitution with diff to compare the outputs of these two programs and find your flag!
