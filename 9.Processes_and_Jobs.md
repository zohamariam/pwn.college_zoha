# Processes and Jobs

## Listing processes
First, we will learn to list running processes using the ps command. Depending on whom you ask, ps either stands for "process snapshot" or "process status", and it lists processes. By default, ps just lists the processes running in your terminal, which honestly isn't very useful:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ ps
    PID TTY          TIME CMD
    329 pts/0    00:00:00 bash
    349 pts/0    00:00:00 ps
hacker@dojo:~$
```
In the above example, we have the shell (bash) and the ps process itself, and that's all that's running on that specific terminal. We also see that each process has a numerical identifier (the Process ID, or PID), which is a number that uniquely identifies every running process in a Linux environment. We also see the terminal on which the commands are running (in this case, the designation pts/0), and the total amount of cpu time that the process has eaten up so far (since these processes are very undemanding, they have yet to eat up even 1 second!).

In the majority of cases, this is all that you'll see with a default ps. To make it useful, we need to pass a few arguments.

As ps is a very old utility, its usage is a bit of a mess. There are two ways to specify arguments.

"Standard" Syntax: in this syntax, you can use -e to list "every" process and -f for a "full format" output, including arguments. These can be combined into a single argument -ef.

"BSD" Syntax: in this syntax, you can use a to list processes for all users, x to list processes that aren't running in a terminal, and u for a "user-readable" output. These can be combined into a single argument aux.

These two methods, ps -ef and ps aux, result in slightly different, but cross-recognizable output.

Let's try it in the dojo:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ ps -ef
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
hacker         1       0  0 05:34 ?        00:00:00 /sbin/docker-init -- /bin/sleep 6h
hacker         7       1  0 05:34 ?        00:00:00 /bin/sleep 6h
hacker       102       1  1 05:34 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node /usr/lib/code-server --auth=none -
hacker       138     102 11 05:34 ?        00:00:07 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node /usr/lib/code-server/out/node/entr
hacker       287     138  0 05:34 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node /usr/lib/code-server/lib/vscode/ou
hacker       318     138  6 05:34 ?        00:00:03 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node --dns-result-order=ipv4first /usr/
hacker       554     138  3 05:35 ?        00:00:00 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node /usr/lib/code-server/lib/vscode/ou
hacker       571     554  0 05:35 pts/0    00:00:00 /usr/bin/bash --init-file /usr/lib/code-server/lib/vscode/out/vs
hacker       695     571  0 05:35 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -ef
hacker@dojo:~$
```
You can see here that there are processes running for the initialization of the challenge environment (docker-init), a timeout before the challenge is automatically terminated to preserve computing resources (sleep 6h to timeout after 6 hours), the VSCode environment (several code-server helper processes), the shell (bash), and my ps -ef command. It's basically the same thing with ps aux:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ ps aux
USER         PID %CPU %MEM    VSZ   RSS TTY      STAT START   TIME COMMAND
hacker         1  0.0  0.0   1128     4 ?        Ss   05:34   0:00 /sbin/docker-init -- /bin/sleep 6h
hacker         7  0.0  0.0   2736   580 ?        S    05:34   0:00 /bin/sleep 6h
hacker       102  0.4  0.0 723944 64660 ?        Sl   05:34   0:00 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node /usr/lib/code-serve
hacker       138  3.3  0.0 968792 106272 ?       Sl   05:34   0:07 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node /usr/lib/code-serve
hacker       287  0.0  0.0 717648 53136 ?        Sl   05:34   0:00 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node /usr/lib/code-serve
hacker       318  3.3  0.0 977472 98256 ?        Sl   05:34   0:06 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node --dns-result-order=
hacker       554  0.4  0.0 650560 55360 ?        Rl   05:35   0:00 /usr/lib/code-server/lib/node /usr/lib/code-serve
hacker       571  0.0  0.0   4600  4032 pts/0    Ss   05:35   0:00 /usr/bin/bash --init-file /usr/lib/code-server/li
hacker      1172  0.0  0.0   5892  2924 pts/0    R+   05:38   0:00 ps aux
hacker@dojo:~$
```
There are many commonalities between ps -ef and ps aux: both display the user (USER column), the PID, the TTY, the start time of the process (STIME/START), the total utilized CPU time (TIME), and the command (CMD/COMMAND). ps -ef additionally outputs the Parent Process ID (PPID), which is the PID of the process that launched the one in question, while ps aux outputs the percentage of total system CPU and Memory that the process is utilizing. Plus, there's a bunch of other stuff we won't get into right now.

Anyways! Let's practice. In this level, I have once again renamed /challenge/run to a random filename, and this time made it so that you cannot ls the /challenge directory! But I also launched it, so you can find it in the running process list, figure out the filename, and relaunch it directly for the flag! Good luck!

NOTE: Both ps -ef and ps aux truncate the command listing to the width of your terminal (which is why the examples above line up so nicely on the right side of the screen. If you can't read the whole path to the process, you might need to enlarge your terminal (or redirect the output somewhere to avoid this truncating behavior)! Alternatively, you can pass the w option twice (e.g., ps -efww or ps auxww) to disable the truncation.

Yahaha, you found me! Here is your flag:

Now I will sleep for a while (so that you could find me with 'ps').

## Killing processes
You've launched processes, you've viewed processes, now you will learn to terminate processes! In Linux, this is done using the aggressively-named kill command. With default options (which is all we'll cover in this level), kill will terminate a process in a way that gives it a chance to get its affairs in order before ceasing to exist.

Let's say you had a pesky sleep process (sleep is a program that simply hangs out for the number of seconds specified on the commandline, in this case, 1337 seconds) that you launched in another terminal, like so:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ sleep 1337
```
How do we get rid of it? You use kill to terminate it by passing the process identifier (the PID from ps) as an argument, like so:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ ps -e | grep sleep
 342 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep
hacker@dojo:~$ kill 342
hacker@dojo:~$ ps -e | grep sleep
hacker@dojo:~$
```
Now, it's time to terminate your first process! In this challenge, /challenge/run will refuse to run while /challenge/dont_run is running! You must find the dont_run process and kill it. If you fail, pwn.college will disavow all knowledge of your mission. Good luck.

hacker@processes~killing-processes:~$ kill 136
hacker@processes~killing-processes:~$ ps -ef | grep /challenge/dont_run
hacker       165     145  0 17:16 pts/0    00:00:00 grep --color=auto /challenge/dont_run
hacker@processes~killing-processes:~$ kill 165
bash: kill: (165) - No such process
hacker@processes~killing-processes:~$ /challenge/run
