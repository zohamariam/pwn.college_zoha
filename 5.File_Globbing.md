# File Globbing

## Matching with *
The first glob we'll learn is *. When it encounters a * character in any argument, the shell will treat it as a "wildcard" and try to replace that argument with any files that match the pattern. It's easier to show you than explain:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_*
Look: file_a file_b file_c
```
Of course, though in this case, the glob resulted in multiple arguments, it can just as simply match only one. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_*
Look: file_a
```
When zero files are matched, by default, the shell leaves the glob unchanged:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: nope_*
Look: nope_*
```
The * matches any part of the filename except for / or a leading . character. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ echo ONE: /ho*/*ck*
ONE: /home/hacker
hacker@dojo:~$ echo TWO: /*/hacker
TWO: /home/hacker
hacker@dojo:~$ echo THREE: ../*
THREE: ../hacker
```
Now, practice this yourself! Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use globbing to keep the argument you pass to cd to at most four characters! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{EGHW7c2MdvskoO8w0n7XUb-V6Y6.QXxIDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /ch*
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{EGHW7c2MdvskoO8w0n7XUb-V6Y6.QXxIDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}
```

## Matching with ?
Next, let's learn about ?. When it encounters a ? character in any argument, the shell will treat it as a single-character wildcard. This works like *, but only matches one character. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_cc
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_cc
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_?
Look: file_a file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_??
Look: file_cc
```
Now, practice this yourself! Starting from your home directory, change your directory to /challenge, but use the ? character instead of c and l in the argument to cd! Once you're there, run /challenge/run for the flag!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{wdXPMlX8_igfSpWpwNcKWQv9Ueh.QXyIDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:~$ cd /?ha??enge
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge$ /challenge/run
You ran me with the working directory of /challenge! Here is your flag:
pwn.college{wdXPMlX8_igfSpWpwNcKWQv9Ueh.QXyIDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}
```

## Matching with []
Next, we will cover []. The square brackets are, essentially, a limited form of ?, in that instead of matching any character, [] is a wildcard for some subset of potential characters, specified within the brackets. For example, [pwn] will match the character p, w, or n. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: file_[ab]
Look: file_a file_b
```
Try it here! We've placed a bunch of files in /challenge/files. Change your working directory to /challenge/files and run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{Y1whFKAlljI0PR88c3A2VfWbIF5.QXzIDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

```
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~matching-with-:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{Y1whFKAlljI0PR88c3A2VfWbIF5.QXzIDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}
```

## Matching paths with []
Globbing happens on a path basis, so you can expand entire paths with your globbed arguments. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_a
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_b
hacker@dojo:~$ touch file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ ls
file_a	file_b	file_c
hacker@dojo:~$ echo Look: /home/hacker/file_[ab]
Look: /home/hacker/file_a /home/hacker/file_b
```
Now it's your turn. Once more, we've placed a bunch of files in /challenge/files. Starting from your home directory, run /challenge/run with a single argument that bracket-globs into the absolute paths to the file_b, file_a, file_s, and file_h files!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{IWhfzFSZOl94STw-h3i6btMOrXR.QX0IDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

```
hacker@globbing~matching-paths-with-:~$ /challenge/run /challenge/files/file_[absh]
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{IWhfzFSZOl94STw-h3i6btMOrXR.QX0IDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}
```

## Multiple globs
So far, you've specified one glob at a time, but you can do more! Bash supports the expansion of multiple globs in a single word. For example:
```
hacker@dojo:~$ cat /*fl*
pwn.college{YEAH}
hacker@dojo:~$
```
What happens above is that the shell looks for all files in / that start with anything (including nothing), then have an f and an l, and end in anything (including ag, which makes flag).

Now you try it. We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and run /challenge/run, providing a single argument: a short (3 characters or less) globbed word with two * globs in it that covers every word that contains the letter p.

```
hacker@globbing~multiple-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files

You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{sQANS4KLIGgzTgMys8StpIVNurY.0lM3kjNxwCO4kjNzEzW}
```

## Mixing globs
Now, let's put the previous levels together! We put a few happy, but diversely-named files in /challenge/files. Go cd there and, using the globbing you've learned, write a single, short (6 characters or less) glob that (when passed as an argument to /challenge/run) will match the files "challenging", "educational", and "pwning"!

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{oxnIQhDpr7KYNhEbPSnFVFH4n7b.QX1IDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}`

This challenge took a lot of time for me to figure out the right combination to crack the code to match all 3 files. I first thought of including the [gl] in the end, but that ended up matching more words which weren't in the criteria, and after a lot of consideration, i tried using [cep]* since all words begin with a different letter and it worked.

```
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:~$ cd /challenge/files
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [lin]
Your expansion did not expand to the requested files (challenging, educational,
pwning). Instead, it expanded to:
[lin]
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *i*n*
Error: you did not use a square bracket glob...
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *i*n*[g]
Error: your argument is too long! It must be 6 characters or less.
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run *[gl]
Your expansion did not expand to the requested files (challenging, educational,
pwning). Instead, it expanded to:
amazing beautiful challenging delightful educational jovial laughing magical pwning thrilling uplifting wonderful xenial youthful
hacker@globbing~mixing-globs:/challenge/files$ /challenge/run [cep]*
You got it! Here is your flag!
pwn.college{oxnIQhDpr7KYNhEbPSnFVFH4n7b.QX1IDO0wCO4kjNzEzW}
```
